# Deep Q Network (DQN) Atari Breakout

This is a Python + TensorFlow implementation of [the original DQN paper by Deepmind (Lua + Torch)](https://github.com/deepmind/dqn).

There are some different with the original implementation because of my need (get the agent run) and preference (image processing technique).

There is a [colab ready notebook](colab_train_dqn.ipynb) that you can *Restart and run all*.

## CartPole

- [DQN](dqn_cartpole.ipynb) is able to perform better than randomness after an hour of training.
